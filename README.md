# Genshin Impact Toki Pona Translation
A fan project of mine dedicated to eventually translating everything in Genshin Impact (also possibly a handful of build guides) into the conlang Toki Pona by jan Sonja. This is a language I really enjoy, and wanted to share this project in GitHub. I'll try to work on updating translations every day.
